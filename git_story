Humpty Dumpty was a giant egg that sat on a hill. One day as he was sitting, a giant gust of wind blew him over, causing him to roll.
As Humpty bowled and rolled down the hill with increasing speed, he thought about where he would crash. The local town's mattress store was nearby, luckily for Humpty.
Humpty had rolled all the way on a bed made of golden goose feathers, what a lucky egg.
